### Background 
Today, almost all companies are trying to adopt DS solutions and techniques into their business programs. The adoption of DS offers certain unique capabilities and opportunities that impact both sides of the balance sheet, increase revenue and reduce costs. For some businesses like fleet management and OTT platforms, DS adoption is easy. However, it is difficult for some other businesses like manufacturing and healthcare. 

Regardless of how difficult it is to implement DS projects, the benefits they offer outweigh the efforts one needs to put in. For instance, in manufacturing companies, workers are required to wear safety equipment. Now, it can be extremely labour intensive for security personnel to look at all the CCTV footage at once to keep a watch on the workers. However, a DS solution can do this quite easily. It can use a computer vision model to consume all the CCTV footage, identify employees who are not wearing safety equipment and highlight these employees to security personnel. The security personnel can then decide the action that needs to be taken. 

Usually, the companies that are at an advanced stage in DS adoption have in-house data science teams, while other companies start by outsourcing projects to consultants. 

### Problem Statement

OLIST is a Brazilian e-commerce giant similar to Amazon. The company is looking to leverage the power of analytics to improve its processes and improve its product offering. You need to step into the shoes of the DS transformation in charge. The leadership team at OLIST has identified some projects that they think will create value in the business. 
Now, there are certain constraints in the company; the company has set up the data science team recently. The team is small, and resources are limited. Given such a situation, choose the right roadmap for DS adoption based on the size, feasibility, complexity and value of the use case.
You are required to create a presentation that will demonstrate the road to DS adoption and the monetary benefits that will accompany the adoption. You may use the following points to create your presentation:

#### Company objective

- Feasibility check of the project 
- Data and skill requirements for the project
- DS solution approach (Refer to the module on Data Strategy)
- Changes in the current process on account of adopting the solution
